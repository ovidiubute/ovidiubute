### Hi there 👋

I’m Ovidiu — a Software Engineer from Romania with a knack for building reliable systems and leading teams through complex challenges. My journey started back in 2005, and since then I’ve moved from experimenting with different languages to finding my sweet spot in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Today I work as a Technical Lead at Fabric, helping shape Hollywood’s go-to solution for title management. Alongside application development, I’ve recently been diving deeper into cloud infrastructure — embracing the world of IaC and cloud-native tooling — which has been both humbling and exciting.
