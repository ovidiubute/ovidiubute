### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile. I am a Software Engineer based in Romania. I've been coding since 2005 and transitioned to remote work in 2020. Over the years, I've contributed to several SaaS companies spanning industries like social media, marketing, gaming, and entertainment.

Currently, I am working as a Technical Lead at [Fabric](https://www.fabricdata.com/). Fabric is Hollywood's go to title management solution.

In my spare time, I love traveling, tinkering with home automation, playing video games, and digging into books on economics and capital markets.
